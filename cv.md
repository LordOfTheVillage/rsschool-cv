## Briefly about me:
I started my first steps in programming back in the 9th grade, when I first got acquainted with JavaScript. The tight academic schedule did not allow me to work hard on my hobby. However, everything changed with the admission to the university. Then I got acquainted with the C/C++ language, HTML/CSS, Bash, as well as the very basics of mobile development on Kotlin and Swift. Then I clearly realized my goal: to enter and gain a foothold in the IT world. After getting a little acquainted with React.js and jQuery, I finally decided on the choice, namely the front-end. My aspiration is also to delve not only into the frontend, but also into the backend in order to become a full-back developer in the future (if I like the backend as well as the frontend). It seems to me that I have such qualities as responsibility, diligence, sociability and the desire to learn everything new not only in programming, but also in other spheres of life.

## My skills:
* HTML/CSS
* JavaScript
* React.js
* C/C++
* Linux & Bash  

## Code exmple: 
```
function multiply(a, b) {
  return a * b;
}  

let result = multiply(4, 8);
alert( result );
```

## Education:
BSU, Faculty of Mechanics and Mathematics
